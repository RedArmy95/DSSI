# Q1 Joining educational data
- Reading education data from the following csv file.

## Reading education data
```{r}
read_csv("data/opendata107Y020.csv", col_names = TRUE) %>%
    slice(-1) %>% 
    glimpse()
```

## Town level educational data 
- Following In-Class tutorial, using `group_by()` to create town level statistical data.


```{r}
data <- read_csv("data/opendata107Y020.csv") 
edu = data[-1,]
edu[,5:51] <- as.numeric(unlist(edu[,5:51]))
edu <- edu %>%
  group_by(site_id)  %>%
  summarise_at(vars(edu_age_15up_total : edu_illiterate_f),sum) 

edu[5,2:48] <- edu[5,2:48]+edu[6,2:48]
edu[5,1] = "高雄市鳳山區"
edu <- edu[-6,]
edu

edu[28,2:48] <- edu[28,2:48]+edu[29,2:48]
edu[28,1] = "高雄市三民區"
edu <- edu[-29,]
```

```{r}
edu <- edu %>%
  gather("education","num",3:48) %>%
  mutate(education = str_replace(education, "edu_", "")) %>%
  mutate(education = str_replace(education, "_m", "")) %>%
  mutate(education = str_replace(education, "_f", "")) %>%
  arrange(site_id)
```

```{r}
edu_town <- edu %>%
    group_by(site_id) %>%
    summarise(
        people = sum(num),
        doctor = sum(num[str_detect(education,"doctor")]),
        master = sum(num[str_detect(education,"master")]),
        university = sum(num[str_detect(education,c("university","juniorcollege"))]),
        senior = sum(num[str_detect(education,c("seniorvocational_g","senior_g"))]),
        junior = sum(num[str_detect(education,c("juniorvocational_gra","junior_gra"))]),
        primary = sum(num[str_detect(education,"primary_gra")]),
        other = sum(num[str_detect(education,c("self","illiterate"))])
        ) %>%
    ungroup() %>%
  mutate(perc_doctor = doctor / people,
           perc_master = master / people,
          perc_university = university / people,
         perc_senior = senior / people,
         perc_junior = junior / people,
         perc_primary = primary / people,
         perc_other = other / people) 
sample_n(edu_town,10)
```

```{r}
age <- read_csv("data/opendata107Y030.csv")
age = age[-1,]
age[,5:156] <- as.numeric(unlist(age[,5:156]))
age <- age %>%
  gather("status","num",5:156) %>%
  mutate(status = str_replace(status, "15down", "0_14")) %>%
  mutate(status = str_replace(status, "100up", "100_105")) %>%
  mutate(status = str_replace(status, "single_age", "single")) %>%
  separate(status, c("married", "ageLower", "ageUpper", "gender")) %>%
  arrange(site_id)
```

```{r}
age_town <- age %>%
filter(ageLower >= 20) %>%
    group_by(site_id) %>%
    summarise(
        people = sum(num),
        elderSum = sum(num[ageLower >= 65]),
        marriedSum = sum(num[!married %in% ("single")])
        ) %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    mutate(elderPerc = elderSum / people,
           marriedPerc = marriedSum / people) 

  sample_n(age_town,10)
```

```{r}
age_town[5,2:6] <- age_town[5,2:6]+age_town[6,2:6]
age_town[5,1] = "高雄市鳳山區"
age_town <- age_town[-6,]

age_town[28,2:6] <- age_town[28,2:6]+age_town[29,2:6]
age_town[28,1] = "高雄市三民區"
age_town <- age_town[-29,]
```

```{r}
ref10 <- read_csv("data/referendum_byTown/ref10.csv")
colnames(ref10)
names(ref10) <- c("refno", "county", "town", "n_agree", "n_disagree", "n_valid", "n_invalid", "n_ticket", "n_people", "perc_ticket", "perc_agree", "perc_disagree", "agree_disagree")

ref10_town <- ref10 %>%
    filter(!is.na(town)) %>%
    mutate(townfull = paste0(county, town)) %>%
    select(townfull, n_agree, n_disagree, n_valid, n_invalid, n_ticket, n_people) %>%
    mutate(perc_ticket = n_ticket / n_people,
           perc_agree = n_agree / n_ticket,
           perc_disagree = 1 - perc_agree) 
```

## Add code chunks as you need here. 



## Joining data together
- Joining education, age, marriage, and referendum 10th agreement together
```{r}
full <- age_town %>%
inner_join(edu_town, by = c("site_id" = "site_id")) %>%
  mutate(site_id = str_replace(site_id,"　區","區")) %>%
  inner_join(ref10_town,by = c("site_id" = "townfull")) %>%
  select(-people.y) %>%
  rename(population = people.x)
```

## **Q1 Ans: Joined data dimension**
- using `dim()` to display data dimension (should be 368). TAs will score Q1 according to the outcome.
```{r}
 dim(full)
```


## **Q1 Ans: glimpse()**
- Using `glimpse()` to print out data you join below. TAs will score Q1 according to the `glimpse()` outcome.
```{r}
 glimpse(full)
```

# Q2 Open Question - Joining one more dimension
- TASK: Collecting one more dimension from open data for town level and join it with the eucation, married, age, and referendum data.


## Read the file
```{r}
density <- read_csv("data/opendataN0101.csv")
density <- density[-1,]
density <- density[-(369:375),]

view(density)
```

## Display the data dimension of the file
```{r}
dim(density)
```

## Add code chunks as you need

```{r}
dens_town <- density %>%
  select(site_id, area, population_density)

full2 <- full %>%
  inner_join(dens_town, by = "site_id")
```

## **Q2 Ans: Answer following questions**
- Data source link (the page you download the data): 
https://data.moi.gov.tw/MoiOD/Data/DataDetail.aspx?oid=D1450798-F85B-4063-9761-A24B8929A684

- Describe the data source in your words: 
每個鄉鎮市區的面積與人口密度


## **Q2 Ans: Dim() of joined data frame**

```{r}
dim(full2)
```


## **Q2 Ans: glimpse() of joined data frame**
```{r}
glimpse(full2) 
```

# Q3 Open question - Linear regression
 - Now, you have age, marriage, and education as indenpendent variables and referendum 10th agreement as the dependent variable.
 - Go online and search how to run regression with R
 - Report the regression result 

## **Q3 Ans**
```{r}
Data.ref <- cbind(full$population,full$elderPerc,full$marriedPerc,
                  full$perc_doctor, full$perc_master, full$perc_university, full$perc_senior,
                  full$perc_junior, full$perc_primary,
                  full$perc_other)
linearModelVar <- lm(full$perc_agree ~ Data.ref)
cat("# # # # The regression model # # # ","\n")
print(summary(linearModelVar))
```
# 去除p-value > 0.05的變數

```{r}
Data.ref2 <- cbind(full$population,full$elderPerc,full$marriedPerc,
                  full$perc_university, full$perc_senior, full$perc_other)
linearModelVar2 <- lm(full$perc_agree ~ Data.ref2)
cat("# # # # The regression model # # # ","\n")
print(summary(linearModelVar2))
```

此模型p-value < 0.05，顯示其有效，R-square為0.5904，顯示59.04%的資料可以由此模型解釋

人口、老年人比例、已婚比例、大學人口比例、高中職人口比例及其他教育程度人口比例為重要變數

其中已婚人口的比例及高中職畢業的人口比例與同意率呈正相關，而其他變數則呈負相關。

# Q4 Challenge: The median of grouped data
- Calculating age median of grouped data
- Reference: https://www.themathdoctors.org/finding-the-median-of-grouped-data/
- Solve it wit dplyr pkgs
- If you can't answer the question correctly, keep your code (even wrong) to get partial scores.

## **Q4 Ans: glimpse()**

Estimated Median = L + [(n/2) - B] / G * w�
where:

L is the lower class boundary of the group containing the median
n is the total number of values
B is the cumulative frequency of the groups before the median group
G is the frequency of the median group
w is the group width

```{r}
age_median <- age %>%
  group_by(site_id) %>%
  mutate(cs = cumsum(num), population = max(cs)) %>%
  filter(cs < max(cs)/2) %>%
  mutate(median_num = max(cs)) %>%
  filter(cs == median_num) %>%
  select(site_id, ageUpper, ageLower, population, median_num, num) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(median = as.numeric(ageLower) + ((population/2)-median_num) / num * 5 ) 
 glimpse(age_median)
```
